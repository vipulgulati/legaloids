						<h2 class="entry-title">About us:</h2>
						<p>Legaloids is a boutique firm of lawyers, company secretaries and chartered accountant. The Firm acquired its professionals for their expertise in particular field. The firm is created by a group of people having experience of working for large organizations in India and handling large transactions for international clients. </p>
<p>The partners after spending significant part of their professional lives in fast paced commercial lawyering realized that relationship and values are something which lasts for ever and can withstand the vagaries of economic uncertainties around the world. In order to create a specialized and relationship based practice, the  partners decided to set up this boutique firm where there is greater focus on client relationship and client servicing rather than running around the globe to meet the targets.</p>
